I took part in this project during my second semester of my university studies. 2 other friends and I wrote the entire project code.\r\n\r\nEvery line of code is written by us. You are free to view it and use it as you see fit. I (and my friends) would want you to learn from this code as we did when we wrote it. If you do get to learn something from it, email me for a small 'Thanks' and be sure to tell me your comments, how you used it, etc. :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
